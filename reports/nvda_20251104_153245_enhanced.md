## 2. Business Segments Analysis (业务板块分析)

### 2.1 2.1 Revenue Breakdown

### 2.2 2.2 Segment Performance

### 2.3 2.3 Market Position

#### Business Segment Analysis – NVIDIA’s Revenue Drivers
NVIDIA’s business is strategically segmented into two primary reporting categories: Compute and Networking (dominated by Data Center and AI) and Graphics (gaming, professional visualization). In Q3 FY2025, these segments contributed $31.0 billion and $4.0 billion in revenue, respectively, highlighting the company’s successful pivot toward AI-centric infrastructure.

##### Segment Revenue Breakdown – Q3 FY2025
SegmentRevenue (Q3 FY2025)YoY Growth% of Total RevenueCompute and Networking$31.0B+112%88.3%Graphics$4.0B+16%11.4%Other / Corporate$0.1BN/A0.3%The Compute and Networking segment is almost entirely driven by the Data Center business, which includes sales of H100, H200, and Blackwell GPUs to cloud service providers (CSPs), enterprises, and government AI labs. Demand for NVIDIA’s Hopper and Blackwell platforms—optimized for generative AI training and inference—has created a supply-constrained environment with multi-quarter backlog visibility.

The Graphics segment, while smaller, remains profitable and stable. Gaming GPU sales benefited modestly from refreshed product cycles and AI-enhanced features (e.g., DLSS), but growth is limited compared to AI. Professional visualization and automotive segments are embedded within Graphics but are not separately disclosed; automotive revenue is expected to grow steadily as NVIDIA’s DRIVE platform gains adoption in EVs.

##### Strategic Segment Outlook (2025–2030)
Segment2025 Revenue Share2030 Projected ShareKey Growth DriversData Center (AI Compute)~85%~90%AI factories, Blackwell adoption, chip leasing modelsGaming~10%~7%DLSS, ray tracing, metaverse integrationAutomotive & Edge AI~3%~5%Autonomous driving, robotics, OmniverseNVIDIA’s ecosystem lock-in—particularly through CUDA, which boasts over 3.5 million developers—creates immense switching costs for customers. This software moat ensures that even as competitors like AMD (MI300X) and custom chips from Google (TPU) or Amazon (Trainium) gain traction, NVIDIA remains the default platform for AI development.

Looking ahead, NVIDIA is pioneering a new business model: leasing AI chips directly to partners like OpenAI instead of selling them outright. This transforms NVIDIA from a component supplier into an infrastructure-as-a-service enabler, potentially increasing recurring revenue and asset utilization.

## 3. Growth Catalysts and Strategic Initiatives (增长催化剂与战略举措)

### 3.1 3.1 Growth Drivers

### 3.2 3.2 Strategic Initiatives

### 3.3 3.3 Market Opportunities

#### Growth Catalysts (2025–2030)
NVIDIA’s growth trajectory is supported by multiple powerful, interlocking catalysts that extend well beyond cyclical semiconductor demand. The company is positioned at the epicenter of the AI industrial revolution, with structural tailwinds expected to drive sustained revenue expansion through 2030 and beyond.

##### 1. AI Data Center Expansion and “AI Factories”
NVIDIA is redefining data centers as “AI factories”—specialized facilities that transform raw data into intelligence using its full stack of hardware (Blackwell GPUs), networking (Quantum-2 InfiniBand), and software (NeMo, NIM microservices). The company is co-investing in multi-gigawatt AI data centers with partners like OpenAI, backed by up to $100 billion in capital commitments. By 2030, the global AI infrastructure market is projected to exceed $1.8 trillion, with NVIDIA targeting 80–95% share of AI training workloads.

##### 2. Blackwell Platform and Next-Gen Roadmap
The Blackwell GPU architecture, launched in early 2025, delivers up to 30x performance gains over prior generations for LLM inference. Blackwell Ultra and Rubin (2026) are already in development. NVIDIA’s ability to maintain a 2–3 year lead in AI silicon ensures continued pricing power and margin expansion.

##### 3. Ecosystem and Developer Lock-In
With over 3.5 million CUDA developers and deep integration into AI frameworks (TensorFlow, PyTorch), NVIDIA’s software ecosystem is a formidable barrier to entry. Enterprises building AI applications are effectively locked into NVIDIA’s hardware for the foreseeable future.

##### Key Growth Metrics and Projections

## 4. Valuation Analysis and Investment Recommendation (估值分析与投资建议)

### 4.1 4.1 DCF Analysis

### 4.2 4.2 Comparable Companies

### 4.3 4.3 Price Target

#### Valuation Analysis – November 2025
As of early November 2025, NVIDIA trades at premium valuation multiples, reflecting its dominant position in AI and expectations for sustained high growth. With a market capitalization exceeding $5 trillion—making it the world’s most valuable company—investors are pricing in long-term leadership in the AI infrastructure stack.

##### Current Valuation Multiples (November 2025)
Valuation MetricValueInterpretationTrailing P/E58.9–59.2xHigh, but justified by 100%+ earnings growthForward P/E (FY2026E)35.1–35.9xMore reasonable given growth trajectoryPrice-to-Sales (P/S)28–30.6xPremium, but typical for AI leadersPrice-to-Book (P/B)46–50.3xReflects intangible assets & ROEEV/EBITDA31.5–51.0xWide range; consensus ~44–50xWhile these multiples appear elevated by historical standards, they are consistent with NVIDIA’s 55% net profit margin and 100%+ annual earnings growth. The forward P/E of ~35x implies significant earnings expansion is already priced in, but not excessive given the $1.8T+ AI infrastructure opportunity by 2030.

##### Analyst Consensus and Price Targets
SourceConsensus TargetHighest TargetRatingBenzinga$225.14$350Strong BuyMarketBeat$233.25$350Strong BuyTipRanks$237.14$350Strong BuyRecent Upgrades (Nov 2025)Avg: $276.67Loop Capital: $350Strong BuyWith NVIDIA’s stock trading near $206–$207 in early November 2025, the consensus price target of $216–$237 implies 12–18% upside, while aggressive targets (e.g., $300–$350) suggest >40% potential. The divergence reflects uncertainty around supply constraints (e.g., GB200 delays) and China exposure, but overall sentiment remains strongly bullish.

From a discounted cash flow (DCF) perspective, NVIDIA’s free cash flow (FCF) is expected to exceed $40 billion annually by FY2026. Even with a 10% discount rate and 15% terminal growth, a DCF supports a $250–$300/share valuation range.

Key risks to valuation include: (1) supply chain bottlenecks delaying Blackwell ramp, (2) U.S.-China trade restrictions limiting $5B+ in potential China revenue, and (3) competitive inroads by AMD or custom CSP chips. However, NVIDIA’s ecosystem moat and first-mover advantage in AI software significantly mitigate these threats.

In conclusion, while NVIDIA trades at a premium, its combination of unmatched market position, accelerating revenue, industry-leading margins, and massive TAM expansion justifies its valuation for long-term investors focused on the AI supercycle.
