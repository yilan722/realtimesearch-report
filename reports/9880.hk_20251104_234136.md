## 4. Valuation Analysis and Investment Recommendation (估值分析与投资建议)

### 4.1 4.1 DCF Analysis

### 4.2 4.2 Comparable Companies

### 4.3 4.3 Price Target

Ubtech Robotics (9880.HK) trades at a significant premium to traditional hardware or industrial peers, reflecting its positioning as a high-growth AI and robotics innovator rather than a conventional manufacturer. With no current earnings, valuation relies heavily on revenue multiples, growth expectations, and optionality in the humanoid robotics market.

The current **price-to-sales (P/S) ratio stands at ~46x**, based on trailing twelve-month revenue. However, forward estimates suggest this could compress rapidly: analysts project 2025E revenue of ~RMB 14–15 billion (implying ~HKD 15–16 billion), which would bring the 2025E P/S down to ~17–20x. Given an expected CAGR of ~60% in revenue through 2027, further compression to single-digit P/S is plausible if execution continues.

The **market capitalization of ~HKD 65 billion** (~USD 8.3B) places Ubtech among the most valuable pure-play robotics companies globally. This valuation embeds substantial expectations for humanoid robot adoption, particularly in industrial settings. For context, if Ubtech captures just 5% of the projected 2030 global humanoid robot market (estimated at $38B by some forecasts), its revenue could exceed $1.9B annually—justifying current levels if margins improve.

Analyst sentiment is broadly positive, with **12 analysts covering the stock** and a consensus leaning toward “Buy” or “Strong Buy.” Target prices range from HKD 140 to HKD 172, with a mean of ~HKD 156. Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan have highlighted Ubtech’s unique full-stack capabilities and early industrial wins as key differentiators. However, independent DCF models suggest fair value closer to HKD 112, implying ~28% downside from recent prices near HKD 143—highlighting the tension between narrative-driven and fundamentals-based valuation.

Key risks to the valuation include delayed profitability, intensifying competition (from both Chinese peers like Fourier Intelligence and global players like Tesla), and macroeconomic headwinds affecting capex budgets in manufacturing.


**Table 4.1**: Revenue Analysis

| Metric | Current | 2025E | 2026E |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| P/S Ratio | 46.0x | 17–20x | 10–12x (est.) |
| P/B Ratio | 25.4x | 25–32x | Likely elevated |
| EPS | Negative | ~-HKD 2.0 | Still negative (est.) |
| Market Cap | HKD 65B | — | — |
