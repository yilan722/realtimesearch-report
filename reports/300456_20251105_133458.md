## Fundamental Analysis

Silex Microsystems (operating under Beijing Silex Microelectronics Co., Ltd., stock code: 300456.SZ), commonly known as Saiwei Electronics, demonstrates a complex but improving fundamental profile as of Q3 2025. Despite a notable revenue contraction, the company has achieved a dramatic surge in profitability, driven primarily by margin expansion and strategic asset management. The core business—focused on MEMS (Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems) process development and wafer manufacturing—remains technologically robust, with global leadership through its Swedish subsidiary, Silex.

Revenue in Q3 2025 stood at RMB 1.12 billion, down 59.17% year-over-year, contributing to a total of RMB 6.82 billion for the first nine months—a 17.37% decline compared to the same period in 2024. However, net profit attributable to shareholders reached RMB 15.76 billion, a staggering 1,438.05% increase YoY. This extraordinary jump is partly attributable to non-recurring gains from asset sales (e.g., the divestiture to Bure Equity AB) and improved operational margins. Gross margin expanded to 38.32%, up 25.54% YoY, while net margin soared to 222.08%, reflecting both one-time gains and underlying operational improvements.

A critical concern lies in the company’s elevated operating expenses. Total selling, administrative, and financial expenses amounted to RMB 5.77 billion in the first three quarters, representing 84.54% of revenue—an increase of 417.46% YoY. This suggests significant cost pressures, possibly tied to R&D, capacity ramp-up, or restructuring. Nevertheless, operating cash flow improved, with RMB 1.66 billion generated in H1 2025, up 17.25% YoY, indicating healthier core operations.

Looking forward, consensus forecasts project revenue of RMB 20.81 billion in 2025 and RMB 25.43 billion in 2026, with net profit expected to normalize at RMB 3.62 billion and RMB 5.33 billion, respectively. This implies that the 2025 net profit figure includes substantial non-operating items, and investors should focus on sustainable earnings power.

## 2. Business Segments Analysis (业务板块分析)

### 2.1 2.1 Revenue Breakdown

### 2.2 2.2 Segment Performance

### 2.3 2.3 Market Position

## Business Segments

Saiwei Electronics operates primarily through two strategic business pillars: **MEMS (Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems)** and **GaN (Gallium Nitride) semiconductor technologies**. The MEMS segment is the dominant and most mature, contributing the vast majority of revenue and global recognition. The GaN segment remains in early commercialization but represents a high-growth frontier aligned with next-generation power electronics.

The MEMS business is executed through a dual-geography model: **Sweden (Silex)** and **China (Beijing Fab3, Shenzhen, and Huairou)**. Silex, based in Sweden, is the world’s largest pure-play MEMS foundry and has consistently ranked #1 in global pure MEMS foundry revenue from 2019–2023. It serves high-end clients in communications, biotech, industrial automation, and automotive sectors, with a client roster that includes global leaders in silicon photonics, LiDAR, and DNA sequencing. In 2024, overseas revenue accounted for 64.14% of total sales, underscoring the international nature of this segment.

The Beijing Fab3 facility is currently in the capacity ramp-up phase, focusing on localization and serving domestic Chinese demand. While still incurring losses due to high depreciation and low utilization, it is strategically vital for long-term market share in China. Additional pilot lines in Shenzhen and Huairou support R&D and early-stage customer prototyping.

The GaN segment is managed through the company’s investment in **JN Crystal (Poly Crystal)**, which produces GaN epitaxial wafers and power devices. Although revenue contribution is currently modest, the global GaN power device market is projected to grow at a 59% CAGR from 2021–2027, positioning this as a key future growth vector.

The company has also divested non-core assets, including its inertial navigation business, to fully transition into a pure-play semiconductor company by 2026.

### 3.2 3.2 Strategic Initiatives

### 3.3 3.3 Market Opportunities

## Growth Catalysts

Saiwei Electronics is positioned to benefit from multiple structural and strategic growth drivers over the next 3–5 years. These catalysts stem from technological leadership, favorable policy tailwinds, expanding end-market demand, and deliberate corporate strategy.

**1. Global MEMS Market Expansion**: The MEMS market is being propelled by AI, IoT, autonomous vehicles, and advanced healthcare diagnostics. Applications such as MEMS-based optical cross-connects (OCS), inertial measurement units (IMUs), and micro-mirrors for LiDAR are gaining traction. Saiwei’s Silex subsidiary is already engaged with pioneers in these fields, providing a first-mover advantage in high-value niches.

**2. Domestic Semiconductor Localization in China**: Under China’s “Made in China 2025” and semiconductor self-sufficiency initiatives, MEMS foundry capacity within China is critically underdeveloped. Beijing Fab3’s ramp-up directly addresses this gap. As Chinese fabless MEMS companies seek reliable domestic manufacturing, Saiwei is the primary beneficiary. Government grants and low-cost financing further de-risk this expansion.

**3. GaN Power Electronics Boom**: The shift toward energy-efficient power systems in electric vehicles, renewable energy inverters, and data centers is accelerating GaN adoption. With its stake in JN Crystal, Saiwei gains exposure to this high-growth segment without full capital burden. Successful GaN product integration could open new revenue streams by 2026–2027.

**4. Operational Leverage from Capacity Utilization**: Once Beijing Fab3 reaches >70% utilization, fixed-cost absorption will dramatically improve margins. Current losses are largely due to underutilization and depreciation. As customer qualifications complete and volume orders commence, operating leverage will kick in.

**5. Strategic Asset Optimization**: The recent sale of non-core assets (e.g., to Bure Equity AB) and the planned exit from navigation businesses streamline the company into a focused semiconductor play, enhancing investor clarity and potentially improving valuation multiples.

Risks to these catalysts include prolonged customer validation cycles, geopolitical friction affecting Swedish operations, and execution delays in China. However, the company’s dual-geography model provides resilience.


**Table 3.7**: Revenue Analysis

| Catalyst | Time Horizon | Impact Potential | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| MEMS Demand from AI/IoT | 2025–2027 | High | Active customer engagements |

### 4.2 4.2 Comparable Companies

### 4.3 4.3 Price Target

## Valuation Analysis

Saiwei Electronics (300456.SZ) presents a nuanced valuation picture as of late 2025. While its current-year net profit is inflated by non-recurring gains, forward-looking metrics suggest a path toward sustainable, high-quality earnings. The market appears to be pricing in both near-term volatility and long-term semiconductor leadership.

Current share price is approximately RMB 24.92 (as of early November 2025). Based on 2025E EPS of RMB 0.49, the forward P/E is ~51x. However, using the normalized 2026E EPS of RMB 0.73, the P/E drops to ~34x—more reasonable for a high-growth semiconductor foundry. Analysts from Northeast Securities have set a 6-month target price of RMB 35, implying ~40% upside, while maintaining a “Buy” rating.

The company’s **P/S ratio stands at 15.05x**, notably above its historical median of 12.24x and the industry median of 11.84x. This premium reflects investor optimism about margin expansion, GaN upside, and China localization benefits. However, it also implies limited margin for execution missteps.

**P/B ratio has declined steadily** from 2.20 in 2023 to an expected 1.80 by 2026, as ROE improves from 2.0% to 8.4%. This indicates the market is beginning to recognize the company’s transition from asset-heavy investment phase to earnings generation.

Relative to global peers like X-FAB or Teledyne DALSA, Saiwei trades at a premium due to its pure-play MEMS focus and growth trajectory in China. However, the high three-fee ratio (84.54% of revenue) and reliance on government subsidies (which contributed significantly to past profits) warrant caution.

Investors should view 2025 as an inflection year: extraordinary profits provide financial flexibility, but the true test lies in 2026–2027, when organic operational performance must carry the valuation.
