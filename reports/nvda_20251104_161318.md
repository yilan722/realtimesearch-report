## 1. Fundamental Analysis (基本面分析)

### 1.1 1.1 Company Overview

### 1.2 1.2 Key Financial Metrics

### 1.3 1.3 Latest Performance

#### Fundamental Analysis of NVIDIA (NVDA)


NVIDIA’s financial performance in Q2 FY2026 (ended July 27, 2025) reflects extraordinary strength, driven by its dominant position in AI infrastructure. Revenue reached a record $46.7 billion, marking a 56% year-over-year increase and a 6% sequential rise from Q1 FY2026’s $44.1 billion. Net income surged to $26.4 billion, up from $18.8 billion in the prior quarter, demonstrating powerful operating leverage and margin expansion. The company reported a non-GAAP gross margin of 72.7%, with guidance for Q3 FY2026 pointing to further improvement—73.3% GAAP and 73.5% non-GAAP.


This profitability is underpinned by NVIDIA’s pricing power, scale advantages, and unmatched efficiency in AI workloads. The company’s capital allocation strategy includes aggressive share repurchases and consistent dividend payments, reinforcing shareholder returns. CEO Jensen Huang has emphasized that AI is a “once-in-a-generation” technological shift, and NVIDIA is positioned as the foundational enabler of this transformation across cloud, enterprise, automotive, and robotics sectors.


From a balance sheet perspective, NVIDIA maintains a strong cash position and manageable debt levels, enabling strategic investments in R&D ($23 billion annually) and infrastructure. The company’s return on equity (ROE) and return on invested capital (ROIC) remain industry-leading, reflecting efficient capital deployment and high-margin operations.

## 2. Business Segments Analysis (业务板块分析)

### 2.1 2.1 Revenue Breakdown

### 2.2 2.2 Segment Performance

### 2.3 2.3 Market Position

#### Business Segment Analysis


NVIDIA operates across several high-growth segments, but its Data Center business has become the overwhelming driver of financial performance. In Q2 FY2026, the Data Center segment accounted for the vast majority of revenue, fueled by global demand for AI training and inference infrastructure. Other segments—Gaming, Professional Visualization, and Automotive—contribute meaningfully but are secondary in scale and growth rate compared to AI-driven data center sales.


The company’s dominance in the AI chip market is staggering: it holds an estimated 86% share in AI GPUs and up to 92% in the data center GPU market as of 2025. This leadership is reinforced by its full-stack approach, combining cutting-edge hardware (e.g., Blackwell, Hopper architectures), proprietary software (CUDA, cuDNN, TensorRT), and integrated systems (DGX, HGX). The CUDA ecosystem, with over 3.5 million developers, creates immense switching costs and network effects that competitors struggle to replicate.


Beyond data centers, NVIDIA’s Gaming segment remains robust, with >80% market share in discrete GPUs. The Professional Visualization segment serves industries like architecture, engineering, and media, while the Automotive segment is scaling rapidly through partnerships with Uber (100,000 self-driving cars by 2027) and major OEMs leveraging NVIDIA DRIVE platforms.

NVIDIA’s segmentation strategy leverages cross-segment synergies—e.g., gaming GPUs often pioneer technologies later deployed in data centers—creating a virtuous innovation cycle that sustains competitive advantage.

## 3. Growth Catalysts and Strategic Initiatives (增长催化剂与战略举措)

### 3.1 3.1 Growth Drivers

### 3.2 3.2 Strategic Initiatives

### 3.3 3.3 Market Opportunities

#### Growth Catalysts


NVIDIA’s future growth is anchored in three strategic pillars: AI data center expansion, ecosystem entrenchment, and geographic and vertical diversification. The company is pioneering the concept of “AI factories”—gigascale data centers designed as industrial platforms for AI model training and deployment. CEO Jensen Huang announced at GTC 2025 that NVIDIA will provide blueprints for these facilities, accelerating global adoption by cloud providers and enterprises.


A landmark partnership with OpenAI—backed by a potential $100 billion NVIDIA investment—aims to build at least 10 gigawatts of AI data center capacity, with the first phase operational in H2 2026. This not only secures long-term demand but also vertically integrates NVIDIA into the AI value chain. Additional partnerships with Palantir, Oracle, HPE, and Nokia (including a $1B investment in Nokia for AI-native 6G infrastructure) further embed NVIDIA into critical next-generation systems.


Technologically, the Blackwell Ultra GPU delivers up to 30% performance gains over prior generations, while the upcoming Rubin architecture and Dynamo inference engine promise continued leadership in efficiency and scale. NVIDIA’s 800 VDC power architecture targets a 30% reduction in total cost of ownership (TCO) for AI data centers, addressing a key industry bottleneck.

With a $5 trillion market cap achieved in late 2025, NVIDIA’s growth trajectory remains steep, supported by structural tailwinds in AI adoption across every major industry.
