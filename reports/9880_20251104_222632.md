### 1.3 1.3 Latest Performance

#### Fundamental Analysis of Ubtech Robotics (09880.HK)


Ubtech Robotics (stock code: 09880.HK) remains in a transitional phase characterized by robust top-line growth but persistent bottom-line losses. The company’s fundamentals reflect a high-growth, pre-profitability stage typical of frontier technology firms in the robotics and artificial intelligence sectors. Despite ongoing net losses, key financial metrics show consistent year-over-year improvement, signaling a narrowing path toward potential profitability.


In the first half of 2025, Ubtech reported revenue of RMB 621 million, a 27.55% increase compared to the same period in 2024. Full-year 2025 revenue is projected to reach between RMB 19.29 billion and RMB 20.05 billion. This follows a volatile revenue trajectory: RMB 16.60 billion in 2023, RMB 13.05 billion in 2024, and a rebound expected in 2025. The 2024 decline was largely attributed to strategic portfolio realignment and macroeconomic headwinds, but 2025 data indicates a strong recovery driven by commercialization of its Walker S series and expansion in education and logistics segments.


Profitability remains negative but is improving. The company reported a net loss of RMB 11.6 billion in 2024, down from RMB 12.6 billion in 2023—a 7.9% reduction. Analysts forecast continued loss contraction, with net losses projected at RMB 9.3 billion (2024), RMB 7.2 billion (2025), and RMB 2.8 billion (2026). Earnings per share (EPS) for H1 2025 stood at -RMB 0.94, representing a 23.58% year-over-year improvement.


Ubtech’s balance sheet reflects aggressive investment in R&D and infrastructure. In 2024, R&D expenditure totaled RMB 4.78 billion, or 36.6% of total revenue—among the highest in the global robotics industry. This underscores the company’s commitment to maintaining technological leadership in full-stack robotics, including perception, motion control, and multimodal AI integration.

## 3. Growth Catalysts and Strategic Initiatives (增长催化剂与战略举措)

### 3.1 3.1 Growth Drivers

### 3.2 3.2 Strategic Initiatives

### 3.3 3.3 Market Opportunities

#### Growth Catalysts and Strategic Drivers


Ubtech Robotics is positioned at the confluence of multiple high-impact growth catalysts, spanning policy tailwinds, technological breakthroughs, commercialization momentum, and ecosystem expansion. These drivers collectively underpin the company’s projected revenue CAGR of over 55% from 2024 to 2026.


1. National Policy Support: The 2025 Chinese Government Work Report explicitly included “embodied intelligence” and “humanoid robots” as strategic priorities under the “new quality productive forces” framework. This elevates Ubtech from a commercial entity to a national champion in AI-driven robotics, unlocking access to government contracts, subsidies, and pilot zones. The RMB 1.26 billion Guangxi project exemplifies this policy-to-revenue pipeline.


2. Commercialization Inflection Point: After years of R&D, Ubtech’s Walker S2 humanoid robot has entered commercial deployment. As of November 2025, cumulative humanoid robot orders exceed RMB 6.3 billion, with H1 2025 new orders totaling RMB 17.6 billion (+30.1% YoY). This marks a shift from prototype demonstrations to scalable B2B sales, particularly in logistics, automotive, and smart city infrastructure.


3. Dual-Engine Business Model: Ubtech leverages a “high-end technology + mass-market products” strategy. Industrial humanoids establish technological credibility and generate high-margin revenue, while consumer products (e.g., pet robots) drive brand awareness and volume. This model accelerates feedback loops: consumer data improves AI models, which enhance industrial performance.


4. Global Recognition and Partnerships: Recognition by MIT Technology Review as a “Top 50 Smart Company” and inclusion in Analytics Insight’s “Top 10 Humanoid Robotics Pioneers” enhances global credibility. While currently China-focused, such accolades position Ubtech for future international expansion, especially in ASEAN and Middle Eastern markets seeking smart automation solutions.


5. Capital Market Support: Despite market volatility, Ubtech successfully raised capital via a November 2025 placement of 30.2 million shares at HKD 82/share, raising ~HKD 2.48 billion. Proceeds are earmarked for Walker S2 production and key component procurement. Analysts (e.g., Citi, JPMorgan) view this as a short-term overhang but long-term positive for scaling.

## 4. Valuation Analysis and Investment Recommendation (估值分析与投资建议)

### 4.1 4.1 DCF Analysis

### 4.2 4.2 Comparable Companies

### 4.3 4.3 Price Target

#### Valuation Analysis


Valuing Ubtech Robotics (09880.HK) requires a nuanced approach due to its pre-profitability status, high growth trajectory, and exposure to emerging technologies. Traditional earnings-based metrics like P/E are inapplicable, necessitating reliance on revenue multiples, discounted cash flow (DCF) models, and peer benchmarking.


As of November 2025, Ubtech trades at approximately HKD 143 per share. Given negative earnings (EPS: -HKD 2.84 in 2024), the P/E ratio is undefined. However, the company’s price-to-book (P/B) ratio stands at 26.4x, reflecting significant investor optimism about future asset productivity and intangible value (e.g., IP, brand, ecosystem). While elevated, this is not uncommon for high-growth tech firms in frontier sectors.


A two-stage free cash flow to equity (FCFE) model yields an estimated fair value of HKD 112 per share—implying the current market price is approximately 28% above intrinsic value. This premium is justified only if Ubtech meets or exceeds its aggressive growth and margin expansion targets through 2026.


Analyst consensus supports a moderately optimistic view. The average 12-month target price is HKD 156.17, with a range of HKD 140–178.50. Major institutions like JPMorgan (HKD 178 target) and Citi (Buy rating) emphasize the optionality embedded in humanoid robot commercialization, viewing current losses as necessary investments.


Relative valuation against global peers (e.g., Boston Dynamics, Tesla’s Optimus project, and Chinese peers like Fourier Intelligence) is challenging due to limited public comparables. However, Ubtech’s revenue multiple can be inferred. With 2025E revenue of ~RMB 19.7 billion (~HKD 21.5 billion) and a market cap of ~HKD 360 billion (based on ~2.52 billion shares outstanding), the implied EV/Sales ratio is approximately 16.7x—high but defensible for a market leader in a nascent, high-potential sector.

Investors should view Ubtech as a long-duration growth story. Near-term volatility is likely due to execution risks and market sentiment, but the long-term thesis hinges on successful scaling of humanoid robots and margin inflection. The current valuation embeds high expectations—making it a high-risk, high-reward proposition suitable for growth-oriented portfolios with a 3–5 year horizon.
