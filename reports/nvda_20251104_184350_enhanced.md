## 1. Fundamental Analysis (基本面分析)

### 1.1 1.1 Company Overview

### 1.2 1.2 Key Financial Metrics

### 1.3 1.3 Latest Performance

#### Fundamental Analysis of NVIDIA (NVDA) as of Q2 FY2026 (July 27, 2025)


NVIDIA continues to demonstrate exceptional financial strength, driven overwhelmingly by surging demand for AI infrastructure. In its most recently reported quarter (Q2 FY2026), the company posted revenue of $46.7 billion, representing a 6% sequential increase and a remarkable 56% year-over-year growth. Net income reached approximately $26.4 billion, a significant jump from $18.8 billion in Q1 FY2026. This surge in profitability reflects both strong top-line growth and improved operating leverage, particularly following the resolution of a $4.5 billion export-related charge that impacted Q1 FY2026.


The company’s financial trajectory remains steeply upward. For context, full-year FY2025 revenue totaled $60.92 billion—a 126% increase from FY2023—highlighting the transformative impact of generative AI on NVIDIA’s business model. The Data Center segment, which now accounts for the vast majority of revenue, has become the primary engine of growth, fueled by hyperscaler and enterprise adoption of NVIDIA’s Blackwell GPU architecture.


NVIDIA’s balance sheet remains robust, with minimal debt and substantial cash reserves, enabling aggressive R&D investment and strategic partnerships. Gross margins have expanded significantly due to product mix shifts toward high-margin AI accelerators and economies of scale in software and system-level solutions.


##### Key Financial Metrics – Q2 FY2026 vs Prior Periods

NVIDIA’s fundamentals reflect a company in a hyper-growth phase, uniquely positioned at the epicenter of the AI revolution. While such growth is unlikely to be sustained indefinitely, current financials justify premium valuation multiples, provided execution remains flawless and demand continues unabated.

## 2. Business Segments Analysis (业务板块分析)

### 2.1 2.1 Revenue Breakdown

### 2.2 2.2 Segment Performance

### 2.3 2.3 Market Position

#### Business Segment Analysis: NVIDIA’s Strategic Pillars


NVIDIA has evolved from a gaming GPU company into a full-stack AI infrastructure provider. Its business is now organized around four core segments, with the Data Center segment dominating both revenue and strategic focus as of 2025.


##### 1. Data Center (Primary Growth Driver)


This segment includes AI accelerators (e.g., H100, B100, GB200), networking solutions (Spectrum-X), and full-stack AI systems. It serves cloud service providers (CSPs), enterprises, and government AI initiatives. The Blackwell platform, fully sold out for 2025 production, powers next-generation large language models and AI factories. Revenue from this segment accounted for over 80% of total Q2 FY2026 revenue, with operating margins exceeding 70%.


##### 2. Gaming


While historically NVIDIA’s largest segment, Gaming now plays a secondary role. It includes GeForce GPUs for PCs and consoles. Demand remains healthy but is cyclical and less strategic than AI. NVIDIA leverages its gaming brand to maintain consumer mindshare and cross-sell AI-enhanced features (e.g., DLSS).


##### 3. Professional Visualization & Workstations


This segment serves designers, engineers, and creators using NVIDIA RTX GPUs in workstations. Growth is steady but modest compared to Data Center. It benefits from AI integration in creative software but is not a major revenue contributor.


##### 4. Automotive & Robotics


NVIDIA DRIVE platform powers autonomous vehicles and robotaxis, with partnerships including Uber (robotaxi deployment from 2027) and major OEMs. Though currently a small revenue stream (SegmentRevenue ($B)% of TotalYoY GrowthData Center~38.0~81%+70%+Gaming~5.0~11%+10%Pro Visualization~1.2~3%+15%Automotive~0.8~2%+25%Other~1.7~3%—

NVIDIA’s business model is increasingly centered on AI infrastructure, with other segments serving as complementary or legacy revenue streams. The company’s ability to monetize its software ecosystem (e.g., CUDA, AI Enterprise) alongside hardware creates a formidable moat.

## 3. Growth Catalysts and Strategic Initiatives (增长催化剂与战略举措)

### 3.1 3.1 Growth Drivers

### 3.2 3.2 Strategic Initiatives

### 3.3 3.3 Market Opportunities

#### Growth Catalysts Driving NVIDIA’s Future Expansion


NVIDIA’s growth trajectory is underpinned by multiple structural and strategic catalysts extending well into the latter half of the decade. These include technological leadership, ecosystem expansion, and macro-level AI adoption across industries.


##### 1. AI Factories and Gigawatt-Scale Data Centers


NVIDIA is pioneering the concept of “AI factories”—massive, purpose-built facilities for AI training and inference. The company is working with partners like OpenAI on a $100 billion, 10-gigawatt deployment of NVIDIA systems, with the first gigawatt coming online in late 2026. These facilities require NVIDIA’s full stack: Blackwell/Rubin GPUs, Spectrum-X networking, liquid cooling, and 800V power infrastructure.


##### 2. Next-Generation GPU Roadmap


The Blackwell architecture (2024) is already sold out for 2025. NVIDIA has announced Rubin (2026) and Rubin Ultra, promising 2–3x performance gains. The company is also opening NVLink Fusion to third-party ASICs, expanding its influence beyond its own silicon.


##### 3. Strategic Ecosystem Partnerships


NVIDIA has formed high-impact alliances across sectors:Cloud & AI: Microsoft, Meta, OpenAI, OracleTelecom: Nokia ($1B investment), T-Mobile, for AI-native 6G networksEnterprise Software: Palantir, CrowdStrike for AI-powered cybersecurity and analytics


##### 4. Expansion into New AI Frontiers


Beyond data centers, NVIDIA is targeting:Autonomous Vehicles: Uber robotaxis launching in 2027 using DRIVE ThorRobotics: Isaac platform for industrial and service robotsAI at the Edge: Jetson and Grace Hopper for on-device AI

## 4. Valuation Analysis and Investment Recommendation (估值分析与投资建议)

### 4.1 4.1 DCF Analysis

### 4.2 4.2 Comparable Companies

### 4.3 4.3 Price Target

#### Valuation Analysis: Premium Priced, But Growth-Justified?


As of early November 2025, NVIDIA trades at extremely high valuation multiples, reflecting its dominant position in the AI ecosystem and expectations for continued hyper-growth. With a market capitalization near $5 trillion, it is the world’s most valuable semiconductor company by a wide margin.


##### Current Valuation Multiples (November 2025)


```
Table data (unable to parse):
MetricTrailingForward (FY2026E)InterpretationPrice-to-Earnings (P/E)58.9x35.7xHigh but compressing as earnings catch upPrice-to-Sales (P/S)30.6x19.9xReflects premium for AI leadershipPrice-to-Book (P/B)49.3x—Asset-light model; book value not meaningfulEV/EBITDA31.5–51.0x~35x (est.)High, but typical for high-growth tech
```



The forward P/E of ~35.7x implies the market expects continued robust earnings growth. Annualized Q2 FY2026 net income suggests ~$105 billion in annual net profit, supporting a forward P/E in the mid-30s at a $5T market cap.


##### Analyst Consensus and Price Targets

Notably, Loop Capital recently set a high target of $350 (Nov 3, 2025), reflecting extreme bullishness on AI demand. However, the consensus remains clustered around $220–$225, suggesting limited near-term upside unless Q3 FY2026 (reporting Nov 19, 2025) significantly exceeds expectations.


##### Valuation Context vs. Peers


CompanyForward P/EForward P/SMarket CapNVIDIA35.7x19.9x$5TAMD45x12x$300BIntel20x2.5x$150BTSMC22x8x$800B


Despite its premium, NVIDIA’s valuation is supported by unmatched growth rates, margins, and ecosystem control. However, risks include potential demand saturation, competition, and regulatory headwinds—particularly U.S. export controls costing an estimated $8 billion in 2025 revenue. Investors must weigh extraordinary growth against extraordinary valuation. In sum, NVIDIA is expensive but not necessarily overvalued if AI adoption continues its current trajectory.
